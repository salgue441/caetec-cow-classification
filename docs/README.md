## üß© System Components

The cow detection system consists of several key components:

1. **YOLO Model**: YOLOv9-based object detection model.
2. **Detection Engine**: processes images and applies detection algorithms.
3. **Configurable System**: customizable parameters for detection
4. **CLI Interface**: command-line interface for running inferences
5. **API**: programmatic access to the detection engine
